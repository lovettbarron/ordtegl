## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase-Plan | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Use github-pages gem | 01-01 | Ensures local dev matches production exactly | Locked to Jekyll 3.10.0 but eliminates deployment surprises |
| Warm neutrals palette | 01-01 | Matches Ordtegl iOS app aesthetic | Calming, accessible colors for language learning context |
| Semantic color tokens | 01-01 | Enables theme changes by remapping only | Easier maintenance, future theme variations possible |
| System font stack | 01-01 | Zero latency, familiar to users | Better performance, no web font loading |
| Ruby 3.3.7 via rbenv | 01-01 | System Ruby too old for github-pages gem | Consistent Ruby across development environments |

**From PROJECT.md:**
- Jekyll over other SSGs: Native GitHub Pages support, no build action needed
- Email-only support: User preference, simpler than contact form
- Single language (English): Reduces scope, can add Danish later if needed
