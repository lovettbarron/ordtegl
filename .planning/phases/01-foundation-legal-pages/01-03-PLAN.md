<objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create privacy policy page with full content</name>
  <files>_pages/privacy-policy.md</files>
  <action>
Create `_pages/privacy-policy.md` with front matter:
- layout: default
- title: Privacy Policy
- permalink: /privacy/

Structure the document with these sections (use H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections):

**1. Introduction and Last Updated Date**
- Prominent "Last Updated: [date]" at top
- Brief intro: This policy explains what data Ordtegl collects and how it's used

**2. Table of Contents**
- Anchor links to each major section for navigation

**3. How We Improve the App (Analytics)**
- PostHog analytics disclosure
- Categories of events tracked: app opens, feature usage, learning progress patterns
- Note: user identification IS enabled for cohort analysis (per PROJECT.md: "fully anonymized" but "data linked to user ID")
- Data linked to anonymous user ID for cohort analysis
- Opt-out available in app Settings
- PostHog is US-based company with EU data processing (reference DPA)

**4. How We Store Your Data (Backend Sync)**
- Railway-hosted backend for progress synchronization
- What's synced: learning progress, vocabulary completion, FSRS scheduling data
- Authentication: Sign in with Apple (Apple ID used only for authentication)
- Data retention: While account active, deleted upon request

**5. How We Identify You (Sign in with Apple)**
- Sign in with Apple used for account creation
- Apple provides relay email or real email based on user choice
- We store only what Apple provides (email, user identifier)
- No password stored (Apple handles authentication)

**6. Content Error Reporting**
- When user reports vocabulary errors, what's collected:
  - The vocabulary item in question
  - User's correction/suggestion
  - Device type and app version (for debugging)
- Sent to PostHog for quality improvement
- User-initiated only (not automatic)

**7. Your Rights (User Rights)**
- Access: Request copy of your data
- Deletion: Delete account and all data
- Opt-out: Disable analytics in app Settings
- Portability: Export your learning data

**8. Account Deletion**
- Step-by-step instructions: Settings > Account > Delete Account
- What gets deleted: All progress data, analytics associations
- Immediate effect, not recoverable
- Contact email if issues

**9. Data Retention**
- Active accounts: Data retained while using app
- After deletion: Removed within 30 days
- Analytics data: Aggregated statistics retained, individual data removed

**10. GDPR Compliance**
- Data controller: [Name/Entity]
- Legal basis: Consent (analytics), Contract (account/sync)
- EU users: Additional rights under GDPR
- Contact for privacy inquiries: alb+ordtegl@andrewlb.com

**11. Children's Privacy**
- App not intended for children under 13
- Do not knowingly collect data from children
- Contact us if you believe child has provided data

**12. Changes to This Policy**
- Will update Last Updated date
- Significant changes communicated in-app

**13. Contact Us**
- Privacy inquiries: alb+ordtegl@andrewlb.com

Use standard legal tone (formal and precise) per CONTEXT.md decisions.
Include brief plain-language summaries at start of major sections (Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md).
