<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create landing page placeholder and prepare for deployment</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Create `index.html` as a minimal landing page placeholder:

Front matter:
- layout: default
- title: Ordtegl - Learn Danish Vocabulary

Content:
- H1: "Ordtegl"
- Brief description: "A Danish vocabulary learning app using spaced repetition"
- Links to Privacy Policy (/privacy/) and Terms of Service (/terms/)
- Note: "Full landing page coming soon" or similar placeholder text

This is a temporary page - the full landing page with screenshots and App Store link comes in Phase 3.

Verify `_config.yml` has correct settings for GitHub Pages:
- baseurl should be "/ordtegl-public" if deploying to project site (github.io/ordtegl-public/)
- Or baseurl: "" if deploying to organization site or custom domain

Check that all internal links use relative_url filter.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `bundle exec jekyll build` - verify no errors
Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` - verify site works locally at http://localhost:4000
Check that index, /privacy/, and /terms/ all load correctly
  </verify>
  <done>Landing placeholder created, site builds and serves locally without errors</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Commit all site files to the repository:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(01): add Jekyll site with privacy policy and terms of service

- Jekyll foundation with warm neutrals design system
- Privacy policy covering PostHog, backend sync, Sign in with Apple
- Terms of service with exam disclaimer and liability limitations
- Mobile-responsive layout"
```

Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages should automatically build and deploy. If not already configured:
1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main, folder: / (root)
4. Save

Wait for deployment (typically 1-2 minutes). Check Actions tab for build status.

Note the deployed URL format:
- If repo is "ordtegl-public" under user account: https://[username].github.io/ordtegl-public/
- If repo is organization.github.io: https://organization.github.io/

Update `_config.yml` baseurl if needed based on actual deployment URL.
