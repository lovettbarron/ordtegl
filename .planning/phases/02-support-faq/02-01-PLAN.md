<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create support page with contact, deletion, and FAQ sections</name>
  <files>_pages/support.md</files>
  <action>
Create support page at `_pages/support.md` with:

**Front matter:**
```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Support
permalink: /support/
description: Get help with Ordtegl - contact us, delete your account, or find answers to common questions.
---
```

**Page structure (single page, all sections visible):**

1. **Header** - "Support" h1 with brief intro ("We're here to help!")

2. **Contact Us section** (h2 with id="contact")
   - Contact email prominently displayed: alb+ordtegl@andrewlb.com
   - Use mailto link for easy clicking
   - Include response time expectation: "within 7 business days" (per RESEARCH.md)
   - Friendly tone

3. **Account Deletion section** (h2 with id="account-deletion")
   - Clear intro explaining users can delete anytime
   - Step-by-step numbered instructions:
     1. Open Ordtegl on your iOS device
     2. Navigate to Settings
     3. Tap Account
     4. Tap Delete Account
     5. Confirm deletion
   - What gets deleted list (progress, vocabulary records, FSRS data, auth info)
   - Note: deletion is immediate and irreversible
   - Fallback: contact email if issues with in-app deletion
   - Keep visible (NOT in accordion) per Apple requirements

4. **FAQ section** (h2 with id="faq")
   - Use HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` for collapsible items
   - Include 8-12 questions covering:

   **App Basics:**
   - What is Ordtegl?
   - How do I get started?
   - What vocabulary does Ordtegl include?

   **Account & Technical:**
   - How do I create an account?
   - Is my progress synced across devices?
   - How do I reset my learning progress?
   - What data does Ordtegl collect?

   **Exam Prep (with prominent disclaimer):**
   - Can Ordtegl help me prepare for PD2/PD3 exams?
   - Is Ordtegl affiliated with Danish exam bodies?

   **Important:** The exam-related FAQs MUST include the disclaimer:
   "Ordtegl is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any Danish language examination bodies, including Prøveudvalget for Dansk (responsible for PD2, PD3, and other official tests). Ordtegl is supplementary study material only."

**Content tone:**
- Warm, friendly, conversational (per CONTEXT.md)
- Use "we" for conversational parts, "Ordtegl" for formal mentions
- FAQ answers self-contained (no need to visit other pages)
- Plain language throughout

**Reference:** Follow similar structure to privacy-policy.md but more conversational.

# Contact email present

curl -s http://localhost:4000/support/ | grep -E "Delete Account"
# Deletion instructions present

curl -s http://localhost:4000/support/ | grep -E "<details>"
# FAQ uses details/summary elements
```
  </verify>
  <done>
Support page exists at /support/ with:
- Contact email prominently displayed with mailto link
- 5-step account deletion instructions fully visible
- 8+ FAQ items using details/summary accordions
- Exam disclaimer prominently included in FAQ
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add navigation link and accordion styles</name>
  <files>_data/navigation.yml, _sass/_components.scss, assets/css/main.scss</files>
  <action>
**1. Update navigation.yml:**

Add Support to navigation between Terms and any future pages:
```yaml
- name: Home
  url: /
- name: Privacy
  url: /privacy/
- name: Terms
  url: /terms/
- name: Support
  url: /support/
```

**2. Create _sass/_components.scss:**

Add accordion styling for FAQ details/summary elements:

```scss
// FAQ Accordion styling using native details/summary
// Follows warm neutrals design system from _variables.scss

details {
  border: 1px solid $color-border;
  border-radius: $border-radius-sm;
  margin-bottom: $spacing-sm;
  background-color: $color-surface;

  &[open] {
    summary {
      border-bottom: 1px solid $color-border;
    }
  }
}

summary {
  padding: $spacing-sm $spacing-md;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: $color-text-primary;
  list-style: none; // Remove default arrow

  // Custom indicator
  &::before {
    content: "+";
    margin-right: $spacing-xs;
    font-weight: normal;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 1em;
  }

  &:hover {
    color: $color-accent;
  }

  &:focus {
    outline: 2px solid $color-accent;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
}

// Change indicator when open
details[open] summary::before {
  content: "−";
}

// Content padding
details > *:not(summary) {
  padding: 0 $spacing-md $spacing-sm;
}

// Remove default marker in Safari/Chrome
summary::-webkit-details-marker {
  display: none;
}
```

**3. Update assets/css/main.scss:**

Add import for components after layout:
```scss
@import "variables";
@import "base";
@import "layout";
@import "components";
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
# Builds without SASS errors

# Check navigation link appears
curl -s http://localhost:4000/support/ | grep -E 'class="active".*Support|Support.*class="active"'
# Support link has active class on support page

# Check accordion styles compiled
grep -E "details|summary" _site/assets/css/main.css
# Accordion styles present in compiled CSS

# Visual check: serve and inspect accordion behavior
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Visit http://localhost:4000/support/
# FAQ items should have + indicator, expand on click with - indicator
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- Support link appears in site navigation
- FAQ accordion styling uses warm neutrals design tokens
- Accordions expand/collapse with +/- indicators
- Hover state shows terracotta accent color
  </done>
</task>
