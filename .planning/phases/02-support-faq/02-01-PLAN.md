<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create support page with contact, deletion, and FAQ sections</name>
  <files>_pages/support.md</files>
  <action>
Create `_pages/support.md` following the existing page pattern from privacy-policy.md:

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Support
permalink: /support/
---
```

**Page structure (in this order):**

1. **Header** - "Support" title with friendly intro ("We're here to help!")

2. **Table of Contents** - Jump links to each section (Contact, Account Deletion, FAQ)

3. **Contact Us section** - Display email alb+ordtegl@andrewlb.com prominently. Use warm, conversational tone. Can mention response expectations if appropriate.

4. **Account Deletion section** - Step-by-step in-app deletion instructions:
   - Open Ordtegl app
   - Go to Settings
   - Tap "Delete Account"
   - Confirm deletion
   - Note: "Your account and all data will be permanently deleted"
   - Text-only, no screenshots

5. **FAQ section** - Comprehensive coverage with these topic areas:
   - App basics (what is Ordtegl, what languages, how does learning work)
   - Account/technical (sync, Sign in with Apple, data privacy)
   - Exam prep (clear disclaimer about PD2/PD3 non-affiliation)

   Use visible format (all Q&A visible, not accordions) for simplicity. Group by category with subheadings. Each answer should be self-contained.

**Tone:** Friendly and helpful, matching "We're here to help!" feel. Mix "we/our" for conversational parts, "Ordtegl" for formal mentions.

**Exam disclaimer:** Include prominently in FAQ that Ordtegl is not affiliated with or endorsed by PD2 or PD3 exam bodies - it's supplementary study material only.

  url: /
- name: Support
  url: /support/
- name: Privacy
  url: /privacy/
- name: Terms
  url: /terms/
```

This positions Support prominently for users seeking help.
