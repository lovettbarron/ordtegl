# Phase 3: Landing Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Public-facing marketing content for app discovery. Potential users can discover Ordtegl, understand its value for Danish vocabulary learning, and download from App Store. Press resources and attributions are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Value Proposition
- Core message: "Master Danish words through practice"
- Practice/repetition focused positioning (not exam-centric in headline)
- Target audience: Danish language learners preparing for or taking PD2/PD3 exams

### Features to Highlight
- Vocabulary practice — core flashcard/practice functionality
- Exam preparation — PD2/PD3 targeted content
- Progress tracking — learning progress and stats

### Screenshots
- Create placeholder mockups (user will replace with real screenshots later)
- Need at least 3 screenshots per roadmap requirements
- Show key features: practice interface, progress view, vocabulary lists

### App Store Link
- Use placeholder URL for now
- User will provide actual App Store link before launch

### Claude's Discretion
- Hero section design and headline wording
- Screenshot presentation style (carousel, grid, or device mockups)
- Content structure and section ordering
- Visual styling (within existing warm neutrals design system)
- Feature description copywriting
- Exam disclaimer placement and wording (must be visible per requirements)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Match existing site aesthetic (warm neutrals: creams, soft grays, terracotta)
- Exam prep disclaimer must be visible on landing page (per ROADMAP.md success criteria)
- Landing page at root URL (ordtegl-public.github.io/)
