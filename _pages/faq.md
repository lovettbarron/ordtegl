**No.** Ordtegl is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any Danish language examination bodies, including Proveudvalget for Dansk (responsible for PD2, PD3, and other official tests).

  <summary>How does the spaced repetition system work?</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

Ordtegl uses FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler), a modern algorithm that optimizes when you review vocabulary. Here's how it works:

- When you learn a new word, FSRS schedules your first review
- Based on how well you remember the word, the next review is scheduled
- Words you know well are reviewed less frequently
- Words you struggle with are reviewed more often

This approach helps you remember vocabulary long-term while minimizing time spent reviewing words you already know.

  <summary>Can I use Ordtegl offline?</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

Ordtegl requires an internet connection for:

- Initial sign-in and account creation
- Syncing your progress to the cloud
- Downloading vocabulary content

Once vocabulary is downloaded, you can practice even with a spotty connection. Your progress will sync automatically when you're back online.
