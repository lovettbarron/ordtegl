## How We Improve the App (Analytics) {#analytics}

**In plain language:** We use analytics to understand how people use Ordtegl so we can make it better. This data is linked to an anonymous user ID so we can track cohort behavior patterns, but we never sell or share this data with third parties for advertising.

We use PostHog for analytics to understand app usage patterns and improve the learning experience. PostHog collects information about:

- **App opens and session duration** - When you use the app and for how long
- **Feature usage** - Which parts of the app you interact with (vocabulary practice, level selection, settings)
- **Learning progress patterns** - Completion rates, review frequency, and learning patterns across user cohorts

**User identification:** Analytics data is linked to an anonymous user identifier to enable cohort analysis. This allows us to understand how groups of users progress through learning levels and improve the curriculum accordingly. Individual users are not personally identified in our analysis.

**Data processor:** PostHog is a US-based company that processes analytics data under a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with EU data processing compliance.

**Your control:** You can opt out of analytics collection in the app Settings at any time. Opting out does not affect your ability to use Ordtegl.

## How We Store Your Data (Backend Sync) {#backend-sync}

**In plain language:** Your learning progress is saved to our servers so you don't lose it if you switch devices. We use Railway (a cloud hosting service) to store this data securely.

Ordtegl stores your learning progress on a Railway-hosted backend to enable synchronization across devices. This includes:

- **Learning progress data** - Which vocabulary items you've studied and when
- **Vocabulary completion status** - Your progress through each CEFR level (A1-B2)
- **FSRS scheduling data** - Spaced repetition scheduling information to optimize your review timing

**Authentication:** Your account is created and authenticated using Sign in with Apple (see [How We Identify You](#sign-in-with-apple) below).

**Data security:** All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption. Your data is stored in Railway's secure cloud infrastructure.

**Data retention:** Your data is retained while your account is active. You may delete your account and all associated data at any time (see [Account Deletion](#account-deletion) below).

## How We Identify You (Sign in with Apple) {#sign-in-with-apple}

**In plain language:** You sign in with your Apple ID. Apple gives us either your real email or a private relay email, depending on what you choose. We only use this to identify your account—Apple handles the actual login security.

Ordtegl uses Sign in with Apple for account creation and authentication. This provides a secure, privacy-focused authentication method.

**What Apple provides us:**
- An email address (either your real email or Apple's private relay email, based on your choice during sign-in)
- A unique user identifier for authentication

**What we store:**
- The email address Apple provides
- The user identifier for authentication purposes

**What we don't store:**
- Your password (Apple handles all authentication)
- Any other personal information from your Apple account

**Your control:** During Sign in with Apple, you choose whether to share your real email address or use Apple's private relay service. This choice is made in Apple's interface, not in Ordtegl.

## Content Error Reporting {#content-error-reporting}

**In plain language:** If you find an error in our vocabulary content and report it, we collect information about that error so we can fix it. This is only when you explicitly submit a report—we don't automatically collect this data.

When you report an error in vocabulary content, Ordtegl collects:

- **The vocabulary item in question** - The word, definition, or example you're reporting
- **Your correction or suggestion** - The feedback you provide
- **Device type and app version** - For debugging purposes (e.g., "iPhone 14, iOS 17, Ordtegl 1.2.0")

**How it's used:** Error reports are sent to PostHog for quality improvement. We review these reports to correct vocabulary content and improve the learning materials.

**User-initiated only:** Error reporting is entirely voluntary. Ordtegl does not automatically collect error reports—you must explicitly submit a report through the app interface.

## Your Rights {#your-rights}

You have the following rights regarding your personal data:

**Right to Access:** You may request a copy of all personal data we hold about you. Contact us at the email address below.

**Right to Deletion:** You may delete your account and all associated data at any time through the app (see [Account Deletion](#account-deletion) below).

**Right to Rectification:** If any of your data is inaccurate, you may correct it through the app settings or by contacting us.

**Backups:** Deleted data may persist in system backups for up to 30 days, after which it is permanently removed.

**EU users' additional rights:**
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to object to processing
