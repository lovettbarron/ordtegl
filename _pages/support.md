  <summary>Can Ordtegl help me prepare for PD2 or PD3 exams?</summary>

Ordtegl can be a useful supplementary study tool for building your Danish vocabulary. The app covers vocabulary across CEFR levels A1 through B2, which overlaps with vocabulary that may appear in Danish language proficiency tests.

**Important disclaimer:** Ordtegl is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any Danish language examination bodies, including Proveudvalget for Dansk (responsible for PD2, PD3, and other official tests). Ordtegl is supplementary study material only. We make no guarantees about exam outcomes, and using Ordtegl does not guarantee success on any official examination.

For official exam preparation, please consult the official exam body resources and consider formal language courses.

  <summary>Is Ordtegl affiliated with Danish exam bodies?</summary>

**No.** Ordtegl is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any Danish language examination bodies, including Proveudvalget for Dansk (responsible for PD2, PD3, and other official tests).

Ordtegl is an independent vocabulary learning app created as supplementary study material. We are not an official exam preparation resource, and using Ordtegl does not guarantee success on any Danish language examination.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does the spaced repetition system work?</summary>

Ordtegl uses FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler), a modern algorithm that optimizes when you review vocabulary. Here's how it works:

- When you learn a new word, FSRS schedules your first review
- Based on how well you remember the word, the next review is scheduled
- Words you know well are reviewed less frequently
- Words you struggle with are reviewed more often

This approach helps you remember vocabulary long-term while minimizing time spent reviewing words you already know.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use Ordtegl offline?</summary>

Ordtegl requires an internet connection for:

- Initial sign-in and account creation
- Syncing your progress to the cloud
- Downloading vocabulary content

Once vocabulary is downloaded, you can practice even with a spotty connection. Your progress will sync automatically when you're back online.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I report a vocabulary error?</summary>

If you find an error in a word, definition, or example sentence:

1. While viewing the vocabulary item, tap the **Report** button
2. Describe the error you found
3. Submit your report

We review all error reports and update the content regularly. Thank you for helping us improve Ordtegl!
